# Shaping change through play
We are doing this talk because we believe people talk a lot about how things should be or how they want it to be. But there are not enough talks to about how to get there or, what do we need to change to get there.

That's the difficult conversation to have. We would like to share our experience on how to get it started.

	## Hi, we are Wil and Ben from epilot
Before getting into it, I am Wil and next to me is Ben. We work together in Germany at a tech company in the energy sector. Ben will get into more detail about that later.

For now, I would like to share with you part of my story to be here today.
---
### The journey to be here today
By that I mean the succession of events that progressed towards being here on stage today. I left Brazil years ago for Sweden, where I met a funny Italian guy named Andrea some of you may know.

After that I changed cold Sweden for the slightly less cold Germany, where I got my first job abroad; and that's when the story for today starts.

### Being on the move posed some challenges
I joined the product development team of a digital healthcare start-up in Germany, and the culture shock was big.

Let me tell you, those people are conservative. To give you a reference: I mean FAX conservative.

It was a challenge to connect to people. So much was different and I felt the barriers, I felt insecure. Luckily for me, there was Ben and we hit it off right from the start. But still, I didn't want to be isolated from everyone else.

	### First ever team event
/assets/cabin.png

In that context, a bit less than 6 months in the job I had the first team event at that company. I would spend 3 days uninterruptedly with my colleagues, 24/7 in a remote place in the German countryside that looked like this one. Essentially a cabin in the woods in the middle of nowhere.

And was going there without feeling connected personally with those people. I saw I needed something to break the ice.

#### I had an idea

You probably have seen this infamous card game before. If you haven't, have a quick look later how it works but hopefully the examples will still make sense.

I brought it and it was a hit. Turned out eating, drinking and pushing humoristic boundaries was a success as a bonding experience. The game was played to exhaustion.

It was not only enjoyable as a game, but it enabled people to start conversations about topics that would normally not come up and laugh about it. Suddenly in one night they were sharing more than months at work before.
---
	### A while later... something happened
	Covid-19
A lot changed. We used to be in the same physical space daily, not anymore. Remote work was made the default as a company policy. Hiring full-remote workers was now possible.

We had open positions for a long time, with that they started being filled. With people who we would not meet in person. Not for the interview, not for daily work; at best once a year. Bonding became again a challenge, but now a different one.


---
	### We took the learning, games work
	#### How could we enable it remotely?
After some months in full remote work. The social drought hit. It started to feel boring, mechanic. Working with people who you only knew superficially. We started looking for alternatives to improve that, how could we make it better in the new setting.

Seeking this digital setup: we found out we could not only play the existing game, but add our own flair to it. Since the game has only 2 parts, black and white cards, you can easily create your own.

We put a spreadsheet in the cloud and shared for everyone to write down their ideas.  Very simple: a column for prompts and a column for responses.

Everytime people would see funny situations at work, they started adding it. In a few weeks we had more than 500 cards.

We could then render them as cards or even print them out. Big thanks to Robert Middleton who developed playingcards.io. I don't know him and it seems a pet project rather than a high-profile platform, but it was simply perfect for our purpose.

### It didn't take long until we had interesting combinations

As you can see, this combination shows some frustration from the player. The fact it was considered funny and chosen the winner of the round makes it clear it was a feeling shared by all the team. Naturally you are assuming already this was one of our projects, but what is Taron?

---

/assets/taron.mp4
This is Taron. It's the fastest multi-launch roller coaster in the world, located in Phantasialand in Germany. The first launcher accelerates you from 0 to 80km/h. Then you go through a tunnel at that speed and think you're going fast enough. But remember I said "first" launcher. At this point you hit the second, that boosts you again, this time to 117km/h.

---
	### Alright, but why was the project named after Taron?
You might have guesses. But let's take a look at cards again, we got a good answer too.

---

Here you go. Project Taron originally only had a number as a name, but it received the kind nickname for the manner the team was forced into overdrive to meet the requirements for a contract sales had closed without aligning on the feasibility. It was sell first, figure it out later.

---
### Nevertheless, we made it.

/assets/padme_meme.jpg
size: contain

So nobody was happy with it, that was clear. It was completely barebones, usability was comparable to the 90s web. Scope was kept to the minimum to check items off a list, only enough to fulfil the contractual terms. For the users, it was cumbersome to work with it. For developers, it was a pain to maintain and improve.
---
### From the cards to the board
	The talk with upper management
Based on the conversation started in the game and evident frustration of the team, we needed to find a way to prevent this situation of becoming recurrent. As a team, we did not have direct influence on the decisions made by sales and therefore we needed to make aware the people who had. As you can imagine, it is not a good idea to walk in the room saying "we should slow down sales". Chances are that is not going to go well. We had to explain very well *why* that was a good idea.

When distributing work, we had 2 options. Either the team would be assigned to maintenance tasks, fixing bugs and a
ssuring the systems were running as expected. Maintenance work, being recurrent, would steadily block that capacity. Otherwise, the assignments could be about improving the existing features. By refining our system, as these improvements were done we could not only improve the system to our users but also free some of the capacity that would be committed to maintenance. Now the catch: by rushing new features like we did with Taron, on top of the time needed to work on it, we were also creating a maintenance commitment upfront since the quality of the delivery was below standard. If that loop would continue, the team would reach a point of having no capacity whatsover to work on improvements *neither* the new features, so much needed for growth. Our message was: by focusing on short-term gains, we put a long-term limitation on ourselves.

Now if you look at the diagram used to illustrate this, has anyone seen something similar before? What I just described resembles a system archetype, in this case the "limits to growth". These archetypes are common systemic behaviour patterns, and when put to use they can help bring to light how the parts of a system influence one another and can make clear what are the bottlenecks and therefore what you should work on towards improvements. Now I do not mean if you frame your situation in an archetype you are going to have a magic solution, but it helps in understanding the causes, the symptoms, the relations and the alternatives to mitigate your problem. Worth mentioning, this is an example of one archetype. If you are not familiar to archetypes, a good start is looking at systemsthinker.com. There are plenty of articles from different authors on the matter that are helpful to identify different patterns and seek solutions.

## Quick recap
Quick recap: we figured we could use a game to create a safe space where people could surface their frustrations. When looking at the causes of this frustration we found a recurrent, systemic problem rooted. By relating this problem to a system archetype in our system, we could point out what needed to be changed and realised the problem was rooted in the sales-driven culture clashing with a product-driven setup. Talking about culture, we found other interesting points as well like this.

### Games helped us shape our culture pace layer

/assets/layers_culture_ex.png
size: contain

- Our customisation of CAH as a retro & culture discovery method
- Initially triggered by Andres Resminis workshop at Euro IA
- Alternatives with less impact: posters, writing... 
- High impact --> where else can we use this --> Random attempts that felt wrong. 
- Reflection: We realise that CAH worked perfectly on the culture layer: Could our pace layers help?
- After a few years of experimentation at DIFFERENT COMPANIES, we learned the following

size: contain

- What are pace layers: layers that change at a different Pace and impact each other.
- Our epilot pace layers from slow to fast 
- building metaphore
- Huge thanks to Jorge Arango --> Brands adaption 
- Since we started at culture, first look at deep layers

### Our deep layers

/assets/layers_deep.png
size: contain

- deep layers: stabilise our product and accelerate work that done on the layers above.
- strategy layer, hard to get right for everyone
- For shaping this other deep layer, strategy, we saw that an other game is super helpful: Fluxx

## Epilot customisation of Fluxxx
	 #Strategy 

/assets/PXL_20230112_183901607.jpg

- define, strengthen, trial & communicate strategy
- the situation: operationalising high level goals & how we get there
- The approach: play, customise, discuss, repeat: Until we know how we win as a team
- The photo: cross functional & cultural team in a epilot fluxxx card game customisation workshop.

### "Games help people understand what words can't explain"
	K.Weiss, 2022

When I reflected this with my former boss Konstantin Weiß he said something that really resonated with me: "Games are great for helping people understand things that can't be explained"

Culture is really that thing

### Extending our approach to surface layers

/assets/layers_surface.png
size: contain

So we saw two examples for games on the deep layers. 

Using games on the surface layers works under a bit of a different paradigm:  Its way faster, games need to be smaller and address problems in quick easy way. As we were before on the deepest layer, we want to cover you now an example for a game on the most surface layer: the form.
---
Ofc we know that culture moves the slowest, so "immediate" results are nothing you can expect. But it's definitely helping in the long term. As we in the epilot design team aren't the most patient humans, we tried incorporating games & play into the design process of other pace layers as well,  

### Design System Memory
	 #Form

/assets/Screenshot 2023-01-25 at 10.49.59.png

- naming conventions in our design system
- what makes it hard vs. Easy to play

So you can totally copy all the three ideas we presented, but way more exciting: Make your own games

### Game customisation workshop

Her's the format we recommend: 
- spend as much time as you can plying: play play play
- Prep
- Workshop Time

### If you don't shape change, something else will.

Organizations, teams: they are living things. People come and go, culture changes, strategies changes. Like it or not, change happens constantly. Without talking about it, without making decisions and taking action it happens organically and not always how we want it to be. If you want to steer change into a preferable future, better take it into your hands and play the right cards.
